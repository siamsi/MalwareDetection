# MalwareDetection
In this project, I used many EDA, preprocessing, and post-processing steps to reach the main aim of developing an optimum classifier for malware detection. Many XGBoost and LightGBM models are trained to select a model that is fast and accurate enough. To do so, the feature importance functions of the classifiers are used several times. In addition, permutation importance is also used.
